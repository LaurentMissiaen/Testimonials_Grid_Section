## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time I used CSS Grid for a slightly more complex lay-out. I learned a lot about planning out a lay-out, figuring out how many columns there need to be depending on the grid lay-out. I also tried to minimize being specific where specificity wasn't needed. Letting the grid work for me instead of forcing certain behaviors.

### Continued development

Had to work out some issues with defining a height on the body and html element, some things weren't necessary to define and interupted the natural flow. I looked up more information about defining height and width on certain elements an learned a lot.
